The unit cost is known to be $24. What price maximizes net income from sales of the product?\nA manufacturer has been making an electronic appliance for the domestic market.

The cost of manufacturing the appliance is 100F.\nFor the coming year, the manufacturer is planning to sell the same product in a foreign market, where the currency is the marc (M). From surveys, the demand curve in the foreign country is estimated to follow a different linear function, D = 2000 − 2P, where the price is denominated in marcs.\nAll production will be carried out at the manufacturer’s domestic plant, with the expectation that the unit cost will remain unchanged. The exchange rate is 1.5 M/F, and the manufacturer plans to offer an equivalent price in both markets.\n\nIf the manufacturer were to operate exclusively in its domestic market, what would be its profit‐maximizing price and its annual profit?\n\n\nA supply company is a wholesale distributor of components for printers, fax machines, scanners, and related equipment. The company stocks expensive spare parts, which dealers prefer not to hold, and offers same‐day delivery on any order. The firm now serves eight dealers in the region and wishes to locate its distribution facility at a central point. In particular, its dealers have each been assigned a location on an x−y grid, and the company would like to find the best location for the distribution facility.\n\ndetermine the location that minimizes the sum of the distances from the distribution facility to the dealers.\ndetermine the location that minimizes the maximum distance from the distribution facility to any of the dealers.\n\nThe eight dealers and their grid locations are shown in the following table:\n\nDealer locations {.light} —\n\n\nDealer\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\n\n\nX-location\n25\n82\n10\n27\n93\n14\n68\n147\n\n\ny-location\n325\n365\n715\n585\n685\n163\n149\n192\n\n\n\nAn appliance dealer offers free delivery in any one of its five Texas cities, which will be serviced by a single warehouse. The distance from the warehouse site to a given city is considered to be a good proxy for the annual cost of providing delivery service, and the objective is to minimize the total distance from the warehouse to the five cities. The cities are treated as if they were each a single point located at a specific latitude and longitude, as listed in the table below.\nWhen locations are specified in terms of latitude (Lat) and longitude (Lon), a good approximation for the distance (in miles) between two locations is the following: \\[\n   Distance = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\n   \\]\n\nCity Locations\n\n\nCity\nAustin\nHouston\nMidland\nTyler\nWaco\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\n30.3\n30.0\n32.0\n32.4\n31.6\n\n\nLongitude\n97.9\n95.4\n102.2\n95.4\n97.2\n\n\n\n\nA private plane went down off the coast and sank during a bad storm although rescuers were able to save its crew. Aboard the plane was a transmitter that was able to send out a signal for 72 hours after the plane wentdown. When the weather cleared, searchers went out in three different boats carrying equipment that could detect the signal and estimate its distance from the transmitter. The locations of the three boats on an x−y grid and their distance estimates (in miles) are shown in the table below.\n\nBoat Locations\n\n\nSearcher\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nx-location\n25\n35\n70\n\n\ny-location\n60\n40\n10\n\n\nEstimate\n29.3\n34.7\n15.5\n\n\n\n\nA bank offers a credit card that can be used in various locations. The bank’s analysts believe that the percentage P of accounts receivable collected by t months after credit is issued increases at a decreasing rate. Historical data suggest the following function: \\[\nP=0.9(1-e^{-0.6t})\n\\]\nThe average credit issued in any 1 month is $125 million, and historical experience suggests that for new credit issued in any month, collection efforts cost $1 million/month.\n\ndetermine the number of months that collection efforts should be continued if the objective is to maximize the net collections (dollars collected minus collection costs). Allow for fractional months.\n\n\nA firm owns five manufacturing plants that are responsible for the quarterly production of 50,000 pounds of an industrial solvent. The production process exhibits diseconomies of scale. At plant p, the cost of making x thousand pounds of the solvent is approximated by the quadratic function \\(f(x)=(1/c_p)x^2\\) .

Each product has had stable demand for some time, so that average weekly demand is predictable over a 3–6 months’ time frame. however, in the short run, demand fluctuates a great deal, and the load at the machining center varies considerably. The production control system dictates the lot size for each of the products. These quantities are shown, along with other relevant information, in the following table.\n\nProduction information by product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct No.\nDemand (weekly)\nSetup (hours)\nRun time (hrs/thousand)\nLot size\n\n\n\n\n1\n100\n3\n30\n100\n\n\n2\n500\n15\n45\n500\n\n\n3\n50\n6\n75\n100\n\n\n4\n250\n24\n150\n1500\n\n\n\nWith the current lot sizes, the machining center is running at a utilization of about 76%, but long lead times, sometimes over 2 weeks, have discouraged production planners from increasing its load. (A week contains 120 productive hours.) In the past, lead times spiraled out of control when utilization grew to around 80%.\nA lead time model for this problem has been constructed on a spreadsheet. The model permits the user to select lot sizes and thereby influence the average lead time through the bottleneck work center. The lead time prediction is based on advanced modeling techniques, but the details of the model are not of primary importance.\n\n\nThe customers of a particular company are located throughout an area comprised of S square miles, and they are serviced from k warehouses. On average, the distance in miles between a warehouse and customer is given by the formula \\(\\sqrt{(S/k)}\\). The annual capital cost of building a warehouse is $40,000 and the annual operating cost of running a warehouse is $60,000. Annual shipping costs average $1 per mile per customer. Suppose that the current market size is 250,000 customers, spread out over an area of 500 square miles. What is the optimal number of warehouses for the firm to operate?"

For the coming month, the company wants to decide how many of each model to assembly and then test. No computers are in inventory from the previous month, and because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesn’t want to hold any inventory after this month. It believes the most it can sell this month are 600 Basics and 1200 XPs. Each Basic sells for $300 and each XP sells for $450. The cost of component parts for a Basic is $150; for an XP it is $225. Labor is required for assembly and testing. There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available. Each labor hour for assembling costs $11 and each labor hour for testing costs $15. Each Basic requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours for assembling and two hours for testing. PC Tech wants to know how many of each model it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more than it can sell. Objective To use LP to find the best mix of computer models that stays within the company’s labor availability and maximum sales constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Mix Example 3.2 description: (the problem worked in the video)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the previous example, PC Tech must decide how many of each of its computer models to assemble and test, but there are now eight available models, not just two. Each computer must be assembled and then tested, but there are now two lines for testing. The first line tends to test faster, but its labor costs are slightly higher, and each line has a certain number of hours available for testing. Any computer can be tested on either line. The inputs for the model are same as before: (1) the hourly labor costs for assembling and testing, (2) the required labor hours for assembling and testing any computer model, (3) the cost of component parts for each model, (4) the selling prices for each model, (5) the maximum sales for each model, and (6) labor availabilities. These input values are listed in the file Product Mix 2.xlsx. As before, the company wants to determine the product mix that maximizes its total net profit. Objective To use LP to find the mix of computer models that maximizes total net profit and stays within the labor hour availability and maximum sales constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an EXCELLENT coverage of Portfolio Optimization using LP (allocation modeling). The actual LP formulation is the last 3 minutes or so, the rest you’ll learn in finance, but I suggest watching it as part of this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 exercises\nI suggest trying 2.2 through 2.10, pages 57 - 63. These are very representative of problems you would be expected solve.\n\nA local pizza shop that plans to make all of its sales this Saturday from its sidewalk tables during the town’s holiday parade. On this occasion, the shop’s owners know that customers will buy by the slice and any kind of pizza offered will sell. The Pizza Man offers plain, meat, vegetable, and supreme pizzas. Each variety has its own requirement for sauce, cheese, dough, and toppings (in ounces, as shown in the table), and each has its own selling price. The table shows the quantity of each ingredient for each offering of pizza as well as the amount of each ingredient available and the price of each offering.\n\nPizza Production Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredient\nPlain\nMeat\nVegetable\nSupreme\nAvailable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDough\n5\n5\n5\n5\n200\n\n\n\n\n\nSauce\n3\n3\n3\n3\n90\n\n\n\n\n\nCheese\n4\n3\n3\n4\n120\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat\n0\n3\n0\n2\n75\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetables\n0\n0\n3\n2\n40\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n$8\n$10\n$12\n$15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pizza Man expects to use the entire stock of ingredients and wishes to maximize revenue from its sales.\n\nWhat mix of pizzas should be made?

Vendor capacities limit total production capacity to at most 1,200,000 vehicles per year. Subcompacts and compacts are built together in a facility with a total annual capacity of 620,000 cars. Intermediate and luxury cars are produced in another facility with capacity of 400,000; and the truck/van facility has a capacity of 275,000.

The company has seen monthly demand for its electronic and battery-operated detectors rise to 20,000 and 10,000, respectively, and they wish to continue meeting demand. The production process involves three departments: fabrication, assembly, and shipping.

It knows how much space will be required in each month, and it can purchase a variety of lease contracts to meet these needs. For example, it can purchase 1 -month leases in each month from January to May. It can also purchase 2-month leases in January through April, 3-month leases in January through March, 4-month leases in January and February, or a 5-month lease in January. In total, there are 15 possible leases it could use. It must decide which leases to purchase and how many square feet to purchase on each lease.\nSince the space requirements differ month to month, it may be economical to lease only the amount needed each month on a month-by-month basis. On the other hand, the monthly cost for leasing space for additional months is much less than for the first month, so it may be desirable to lease the maximum amount needed for the entire 5 months. Another option is the intermediate approach of changing the total amount of space leased (by adding a new lease and/or having an old lease expire) at least once but not every month. Two or more leases for different terms can begin at the same time.\nThe space requirements (in square feet) and the leasing costs (in dollars per thousand square feet) are given in the two tables below.\n\nSpace Requirements (sq ft)\n\n\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n15.000\n10,000\n20,000\n5,000\n25,000\n\n\n\n\nLeasing costs ($/000 sf\n\n\nLease length\n1 month\n2 months\n3 months\n4 months\n5 months\n\n\n\n\nLease cost\n280\n450\n600\n730\n820\n\n\n\nThe task is to find a leasing schedule that provides the necessary amounts of space at the minimum cost.\n\nDetermine the optimal leasing schedule and the optimal total cost.\nTrace the effects of increasing the space required for January. How will the leasing schedule change? How will the total cost change?\n\n\n\n\nA Tire Company produces four lines of tires: the economy, the glass-belted, the snow, and the radial tire. The problem it faces is to schedule two shifts of production during the last quarter of the calendar year. The production process primarily involves the use of vulcanization, fabrication, and plastometer equipment, but the limiting resource is the availability of the vulcanization machines. The four tire lines require different amounts of time at vulcanization, as tabulated below.\n\nVulcanization time required\n\n\nTire\nEconomy\nGlass\nSnow\nRadial\n\n\n\n\nHours/tire\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n\n\n\nA sales forecast is available, breaking down predicted sales by tire type and by month.\n\nSales forecast\n\n\nSales\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n\n\n\n\nEcon.\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\n\n\nGlass\n18,000\n16,000\n18,000\n\n\nSnow\n4,000\n15,000\n15,000\n\n\nRadial\n6,000\n5,000\n8,000\n\n\n\nIn addition, the number of hours of vulcanizing time, for each shift and for each month, is also known.\n\nHours vulcanizing time required by shift\n\n\n\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n\n\n\n\nShift 1\n110,000\n130,000\n120,000\n\n\nShift 2\n100,000\n120,000\n115,000\n\n\n\nThe labor cost of operating the vulcanizing machines is $10 per hour during the first shift and $14 per hour during the second shift. The other relevant cost is storage: It costs $4 per month for storage and handling at the warehouse, regardless of tire type. This cost is incurred when production is scheduled in advance of demand to ensure that demand is met on time.\n\nWhat production plan will minimize cost and meet demand at Seaboch Tire?\nHow would the solution in (a) change if sales for each tire in December were 10% higher?"

For the coming month, the company wants to decide how many of each model to assembly and then test. No computers are in inventory from the previous month, and because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesn’t want to hold any inventory after this month. It believes the most it can sell this month are 600 Basics and 1200 XPs. Each Basic sells for $300 and each XP sells for $450. The cost of component parts for a Basic is $150; for an XP it is $225. Labor is required for assembly and testing. There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available. Each labor hour for assembling costs $11 and each labor hour for testing costs $15. Each Basic requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours for assembling and two hours for testing. PC Tech wants to know how many of each model it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more than it can sell. Objective To use LP to find the best mix of computer models that stays within the company’s labor availability and maximum sales constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Mix Example 3.2 description: (the problem worked in the video)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the previous example, PC Tech must decide how many of each of its computer models to assemble and test, but there are now eight available models, not just two. Each computer must be assembled and then tested, but there are now two lines for testing. The first line tends to test faster, but its labor costs are slightly higher, and each line has a certain number of hours available for testing. Any computer can be tested on either line. The inputs for the model are same as before: (1) the hourly labor costs for assembling and testing, (2) the required labor hours for assembling and testing any computer model, (3) the cost of component parts for each model, (4) the selling prices for each model, (5) the maximum sales for each model, and (6) labor availabilities. These input values are listed in the file Product Mix 2.xlsx. As before, the company wants to determine the product mix that maximizes its total net profit. Objective To use LP to find the mix of computer models that maximizes total net profit and stays within the labor hour availability and maximum sales constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an EXCELLENT coverage of Portfolio Optimization using LP (allocation modeling). The actual LP formulation is the last 3 minutes or so, the rest you’ll learn in finance, but I suggest watching it as part of this exercise."

Profit margins, market potential, and fuel efficiency are summarized below.\n\nRequirements by vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nProfit Margin ($/Vehicle)\nPotential Sales\nFuel Efficiency (mpg)\n\n\n\n\nSubcompact\n$1,500\n600,000\n40\n\n\nCompact\n$2,250\n400,000\n34\n\n\nIntermediate\n$2,500\n300,000\n15\n\n\nLuxury\n$4,000\n225,000\n12\n\n\nTruck\n$4,000\n325,000\n20\n\n\nVan\n$2,000\n100,000\n25\n\n\n\nThe Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards require an average fleet fuel efficiency of at least 27 MPG. The company would like to use a linear programming model to understand the implications of government and corporate policies on its production plans.\n\nWhat is the optimal annual profit for the company?\nHow much would the annual profit drop if the fuel efficiency requirement were raised to 28 MPG?\n\n\n\n\nA sudden increase in the demand for smoke detectors has left an alarm company with insufficient capacity to meet demand. The company has seen monthly demand for its electronic and battery-operated detectors rise to 20,000 and 10,000, respectively, and they wish to continue meeting demand. The production process involves three departments: fabrication, assembly, and shipping. The relevant quantitative data on production and prices are summarized below.\n\nProduction and pricing data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment\nMonthly Hours Available\nHours/Unit (Electronic)\nHours/Unit (Battery)\n\n\n\n\nFabrication\n2000\n600,000\n40\n\n\nAssembly\n4200\n400,000\n34\n\n\nShipping\n2500\n300,000\n15\n\n\nVariable cost/unit\n\n$18.80\n$16.00\n\n\nRetail Price\n\n$29.50\n$28.00\n\n\n\nThe company also has the option to obtain additional units from a subcontractor, who has offered to supply up to 20,000 units per month in any combination of electronic and battery-operated models, at a charge of $21.50 per unit. For this price, the subcontractor will test and ship its models directly to the retailers without using Acme’s production process.\n\nWhat are the maximum profit and the corresponding make/buy levels? (This is a planning model, and fractional decisions are acceptable.)\nTrace the effects of increasing fabrication capacity by 10%. How will the optimal make/buy mix change? How will the optimal profit change?\n\n\n\n\nCox Cable Company needs to lease warehouse storage space for 5 months at the start of the year. It knows how much space will be required in each month, and it can purchase a variety of lease contracts to meet these needs. For example, it can purchase 1 -month leases in each month from January to May. It can also purchase 2-month leases in January through April, 3-month leases in January through March, 4-month leases in January and February, or a 5-month lease in January. In total, there are 15 possible leases it could use. It must decide which leases to purchase and how many square feet to purchase on each lease.\nSince the space requirements differ month to month, it may be economical to lease only the amount needed each month on a month-by-month basis. On the other hand, the monthly cost for leasing space for additional months is much less than for the first month, so it may be desirable to lease the maximum amount needed for the entire 5 months. Another option is the intermediate approach of changing the total amount of space leased (by adding a new lease and/or having an old lease expire) at least once but not every month. Two or more leases for different terms can begin at the same time.\nThe space requirements (in square feet) and the leasing costs (in dollars per thousand square feet) are given in the two tables below.\n\nSpace Requirements (sq ft)\n\n\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n15.000\n10,000\n20,000\n5,000\n25,000\n\n\n\n\nLeasing costs ($/000 sf\n\n\nLease length\n1 month\n2 months\n3 months\n4 months\n5 months\n\n\n\n\nLease cost\n280\n450\n600\n730\n820\n\n\n\nThe task is to find a leasing schedule that provides the necessary amounts of space at the minimum cost.\n\nDetermine the optimal leasing schedule and the optimal total cost.\nTrace the effects of increasing the space required for January. How will the leasing schedule change? How will the total cost change?\n\n\n\n\nA Tire Company produces four lines of tires: the economy, the glass-belted, the snow, and the radial tire. The problem it faces is to schedule two shifts of production during the last quarter of the calendar year. The production process primarily involves the use of vulcanization, fabrication, and plastometer equipment, but the limiting resource is the availability of the vulcanization machines. The four tire lines require different amounts of time at vulcanization, as tabulated below.\n\nVulcanization time required\n\n\nTire\nEconomy\nGlass\nSnow\nRadial\n\n\n\n\nHours/tire\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n\n\n\nA sales forecast is available, breaking down predicted sales by tire type and by month.\n\nSales forecast\n\n\nSales\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n\n\n\n\nEcon.\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\n\n\nGlass\n18,000\n16,000\n18,000\n\n\nSnow\n4,000\n15,000\n15,000\n\n\nRadial\n6,000\n5,000\n8,000\n\n\n\nIn addition, the number of hours of vulcanizing time, for each shift and for each month, is also known.\n\nHours vulcanizing time required by shift\n\n\n\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n\n\n\n\nShift 1\n110,000\n130,000\n120,000\n\n\nShift 2\n100,000\n120,000\n115,000\n\n\n\nThe labor cost of operating the vulcanizing machines is $10 per hour during the first shift and $14 per hour during the second shift. The other relevant cost is storage: It costs $4 per month for storage and handling at the warehouse, regardless of tire type. This cost is incurred when production is scheduled in advance of demand to ensure that demand is met on time.\n\nWhat production plan will minimize cost and meet demand at Seaboch Tire?\nHow would the solution in (a) change if sales for each tire in December were 10% higher?"
