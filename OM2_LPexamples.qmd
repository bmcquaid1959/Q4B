### Product Mix Example

The two collapsable problem descriptions are background for the video below.

## Product Mix Example 3.1 description:  (prior problem)

The PC Tech company assembles and then tests two models of computers, Basic and XP. For the coming month, the company wants to decide how many of each model to assembly and then test. No computers are in inventory from the previous month, and because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesn't want to hold any inventory after this month. It believes the most it can sell this month are 600 Basics and 1200 XPs. Each Basic sells for $300 and each XP sells for $450. The cost of component parts for a Basic is $150; for an XP it is $225. Labor is required for assembly and testing. There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available. Each labor hour for assembling costs $11 and each labor hour for testing costs $15. Each Basic requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours for assembling and two hours for testing. PC Tech wants to know how many of each model it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more than it can sell. Objective To use LP to find the best mix of computer models that stays within the company's labor availability and maximum sales constraints.

## Product Mix Example 3.2 description:  (the problem worked in the video)

As in the previous example, PC Tech must decide how many of each of its computer models to assemble and test, but there are now eight available models, not just two. Each computer must be assembled and then tested, but there are now two lines for testing. The first line tends to test faster, but its labor costs are slightly higher, and each line has a certain number of hours available for testing. Any computer can be tested on either line. The inputs for the model are same as before: (1) the hourly labor costs for assembling and testing, (2) the required labor hours for assembling and testing any computer model, (3) the cost of component parts for each model, (4) the selling prices for each model, (5) the maximum sales for each model, and (6) labor availabilities. These input values are listed in the file Product Mix 2.xlsx. As before, the company wants to determine the product mix that maximizes its total net profit. Objective To use LP to find the mix of computer models that maximizes total net profit and stays within the labor hour availability and maximum sales constraints.

### Portfolio Optimization

This is an EXCELLENT coverage of Portfolio Optimization using LP (allocation modeling). The actual LP formulation is the last 3 minutes or so, the rest you'll learn in finance, but I suggest watching it as part of this exercise.

## Practice Exercises

[Chapter 2 exercises](https://lib.pepperdine.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,url,uid,cookie&db=nlebk&AN=1016321&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_57)

I suggest trying 2.2 through 2.10, pages 57 - 63. These are very representative of problems you would be expected solve.

2. A local pizza shop that plans to make all of its sales this Saturday from its sidewalk tables during the town’s holiday parade. On this occasion, the shop’s owners know that customers will buy by the slice and any kind of pizza offered will sell. The Pizza Man offers plain, meat, vegetable, and supreme pizzas. Each variety has its own requirement for sauce, cheese, dough, and toppings (in ounces, as shown in the table), and each has its own selling price. The table shows the quantity of each ingredient for each offering of pizza as well as the amount of each ingredient available and the price of each offering.

    | Ingredient |  Plain  |  Meat  |  Vegetable  |  Supreme  |  Available |
    |:-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | Dough      | 5   | 5   | 5  | 5  | 200 |
    | Sauce      | 3   | 3   | 3  | 3  | 90 |
    | Cheese     | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 120 |
    | Meat       | 0 | 3 | 0 | 2 | 75 |
    | Vegetables | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 40 |
    | Price      | $8 | $10 | $12 | $15 |   | 

    : **Pizza Production Information** {.light}

    The Pizza Man expects to use the entire stock of ingredients and wishes to maximize revenue from its sales.
    i)	What mix of pizzas should be made? (Assume that fractions can be sold and that all will be sold.)
    ii)	What is the maximum sales revenue?
    iii)	Which ingredients are economically scarce (which ones limit profits)?

3. The operations manager at a bank has a staffing problem. Demand for clerical staff varies throughout the day, but 24-hour coverage is necessary because the bank handles a number of international transactions. A recent study has shown how many clerical workers are needed each hour in the course of the day, as in the table below. (Hour 1 is from midnight to 1 am.)

    | Hour  |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|
    |:-----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
    | Staff |4|3|2|2|3|5|6|6|9|10|10|10|12|12|8|6|7|7|7|6|5|4|4|4|

    : **Minimum staffing by hour** {.light}

    Under current labor policies, clerical workers may be assigned to any one of six shifts, some of which overlap. The shifts and salary costs are as follows:
    
    | Shift        | Daily Cost ($) |
    |:-------------|:--------------:|
    | 2 am - 10 am | 160 |
    | 6 am - 2 pm  | 145 |
    | 10 am - 6 pm | 148 |
    | 2 pm - 10 pm | 154 |
    | 6 pm - 2 am  | 156 |
    | 10 pm - 6 am | 160 |

    : **Daily cost per shift** {.light}

    i) Provide the operations manager with a schedule that will deploy enough staff to meet the hourly requirements at the minimum daily total cost.
    i) In the optimal schedule, how many hourly periods are overstaffed?

4. A portfolio manager has developed a list of six investment alternatives for a multi-year planning horizon. These are Treasury bills, Common stock, Corporate bonds, Real estate, Growth funds, and Savings and loans. These investments and their various financial factors are described below. In the table, the return is given as an annual percentage, and the length represents the estimated number of years required for the annual return to be realized. The risk coefficient is a subjective estimate representing the manager’s appraisal of the relative safety of each alternative, on a scale of 1-10 (1=safe, 10-risky). The growth potential is an estimate of the potential increase in value over the horizon.
    
       
    | Alternative      | TB | CS | CB | RE | GF | SL | 
    |:-----------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
    | Length (years)   | 4  | 7  | 8  | 6  | 10 | 5  | 
    | Annual return (%)| 6  | 15 | 12 | 24 | 18 | 9  |
    | Risk coefficient | 1  | 5  | 4  | 8  | 6  | 3  |
    | Growth Potential | 0  | 18 | 10 | 32 | 20 | 7  |

    : **Portfollio datat by alternative** {.light}

    The manager wishes to maximize the return on a $3 million portfolio, subject to the following restrictions:
    * The weighted average length should not exceed 7 years.
    * The weighted average risk coefficient should not exceed five.
    * The weighted average growth potential should be at least 10%.
    * The investment in real estate should be no more than twice the investment in stocks and bonds (i.e., in CS, CB, and GF) combined.
    i) What are the optimal return and the optimal allocation of investment funds? (Give the optimal return in dollars and also as a percentage.)
    ii) What is the marginal rate of return? In other words, what would be the return on the next dollar invested if there were one more dollar in the portfolio?
    iii) For additional investment beyond the original $3 million, how does the optimal allocation change?
